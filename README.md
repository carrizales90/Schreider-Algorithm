# Schreider-Algorithm
This python code computes the Schreider algorithm in its original and modified version as presented in the Article: "Detection of significant seismic quiescence patterns in the Mexican subduction zone using extended Schreider algorithms".

A database of Mexican Seismicity from 1990 until 2024 of the Subduction Cocos plate region is shared (DataBase_SSN_1990-2024.dat). These data was cleaned for use in this Article.
Original data is availabe in the official web-site of the "Servicio Sismol√≥gico Nacional" of Mexico url: http://www.ssn.unam.mx

An example of results is the figure "Example_Quiescence_EQ8.2.png" which correspond to the Figure 5 of our publication.
